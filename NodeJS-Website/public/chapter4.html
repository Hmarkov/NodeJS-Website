    <h2> The impact of policies on emissions reduction over the second carbon budget: </h2>
    <p>
      The second carbon budget was legislated in line with the level recommended by the Committee
      in our first report in 2008. Our analysis identified that the budget could be met by
      implementing a series of policy actions.
      <br>
      Underpinning our recommendation on the level of the second carbon budget, we developed a
      scenario in 2008 setting out the actions that would be required in each sector in order
      to meet the second budget, given expected levels of economic growth and other socio-economic
      factors. We monitor progress against these. It is not necessary for exactly this scenario to
      be followed, but under-performance in one area should be compensated by over-performance
      elsewhere in order to deliver the aggregate ambition in the budget.
      <br>
      Overall our policy indicators for 2017, the last year of the second carbon budget,
      suggest there was limited progress in most areas outside of the EU ETS.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transport. None of our high-level indicators were met. New car emissions, registrations
        of electric vehicles, uptake of biofuels, and distances travelled were all behind schedule.
      </li>
      <li>
        Industry. Our overarching indicator for the sector (i.e. direct combustion CO2 emissions)
        has been met. This largely reflects growth in the manufacturing sector being significantly
        lower than expected in 2008 when the budget was set (see Section 1.3), as well as other
        factors such as plant closures, improvements in energy intensity and changes in the fuel mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buildings. Most of our high-level indicators have not been met. Insulation rates fell very
        significantly after installation programmes (i.e. Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, CERT
        and Community Energy Saving Programme, CESP) ended in 2012, with the replacement obligation
        (ECO) less ambitious than its predecessors and the Green Deal failing to deliver.
        Whilst low-carbon heating appears to exceed the indicator, much of this is either bioenergy
        in the form of domestic biomass (which is not the long-term best use of finite bioenergy
        resources) or reversible air-to-air heat pumps in commercial buildings (generally installed
        for cooling). Residential heat pump sales remained below the levels needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Power. Both our indicators for grid emissions intensity and total renewable generation have
        been met, reflecting the progress made in decarbonising electricity generation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agriculture, land use and forestry. None of our indicators were met, reflecting the lack
        of firm government policy in this area.
      </li>
      <li>
        Waste. Good progress was made reducing waste emissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        F-gases. Our F-gas emissions indicator was not met. The main policy instrument, the EU Fgas
        Regulation, only came into effect in 2015.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, we conclude that UK policies did not deliver ahead of schedule in the second carbon budget
      period. Progress was mostly confined to sectors covered by the EU ETS. In particular, policies have
      contributed significantly to reducing emissions in the power sector.
    </p>

    <h2>Assessment of non-policy factors underpinning the second carbon budget surplus: </h2>
    <p>
      We commissioned Cambridge Econometrics to analyse the impact of non-policy factors on
      reducing emissions during the second carbon budget period.
      <br>
      The study provides an estimate of how much key factors (e.g. GDP and fossil fuel prices)
      have contributed to actual emissions being below the level anticipated when recommending
      the budget level in 2008.
      <br>
      The key message from the study is that had the EU ETS cap and economic conditions turned
      out as originally expected, the second carbon budget would have been missed by around 65
      MtCO2e, showing that policies did not deliver as much as planned:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Around 296 MtCO2e (equivalent to three-quarters) of the outperformance over the second
        carbon budget period is explained by accounting changes in the EU ETS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other than these accounting changes, consistently lower economic growth than expected
        is the main factor which led emissions to meet the budget. UK GDP was 14.5% lower by
        2017 than the Government expected it to be in 2008 (Figure 4.4).
      </li>
      <li>
        The impact of the recession was even more severe in the manufacturing sector, where output
        in 2017 was 22% lower than the level expected in 2008.
      </li>
      <li>
        The combined impact of accounting changes in the EU ETS and lower economic growth more
        than offsets the surplus from the second carbon budget, by around 65 MtCO2e. This
        implies the budget has not been met due to policy measures but rather due to external circumstances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overall, the results of the study are consistent with the Committee’s earlier analysis.
        They show that, without emissions reduction from the financial crisis and from accounting
        changes in the EU ETS, the second carbon budget would have been missed by over 2%.
        These findings support our previous conclusions that the surplus should not be carried forward
        as it is not due to policy being ahead of schedule.
      </li>
    </ul>
