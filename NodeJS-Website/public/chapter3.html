    <h1>Chapter 3: Underlying progress in the UK towards deep emissions</h1>
  </section>

  <div id="content">
    <section id="future">
      <p>
        Future emissions reductions depend on policies and actions taken now. In
        this chapter we review progress against our indicators for measures to reduce emissions and implementation of
        policies to drive future reductions.
        We assess this underlying progress against indicators and milestones that we set out in previous
        progress reports to Parliament to deliver against the legislated carbon budgets and the previous
        2050 target for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, the adoption of a netzero
        target for greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 means that emissions will need to reduce
        further and faster than under the previous target.
        We consider progress towards future carbon budgets and deep decarbonisation by 2050, in
        three sections:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst"><strong>1. Actions to reduce emissions</strong></li>
        <li class="lst"><strong>2. Progress in policy development</strong></li>
        <li class="lst"><strong>3. The net-zero challenge – what is needed from policy now</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="bline" />
    </section>
    <section id="actions">
      <strong class="strong">1. Actions to reduce emissions</strong>
      <p>
        We track progress towards meeting carbon budgets and the 2050 target through the use of
        indicators, which both help to explain progress to date in reducing emissions and provide a
        guide to likely future reductions. The indicators are based on our assessment of the costeffective
        path to meeting the targets, based on the Committee’s scenario work. They are not
        intended to be prescriptive – as long as sufficient overall progress is made, it may be appropriate
        to outperform some indicators and underperform on others. The indicators will need to be
        revised in future to align to the new net-zero target for 2050.
        Progress is generally off-track in most sectors, with only seven out of 24 of the indicators on track
        in 2018 (Table 3.1). Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst">Progress in deploying measures to reduce emissions is off-track across transport, buildings,
          agriculture and land use. In these areas, progress to date is behind virtually every indicator
          we track, often by a wide margin.
          <ul>
            <li class="lst">Reductions in the CO₂ emissions of new vehicles have fallen well short of our indicators.
              Lack of progress over several years has contributed significantly to surface transport now
              being the highest-emitting sector in the UK (Box 3.1).
            </li>
            <li class="lst">Deployment of energy efficiency measures in buildings are running at less than 20% of
              the rate under our indicators, having fallen sharply since policy changes in 2012.
              Deployment of non-bioenergy low-carbon heat (e.g. heat pumps) remains weak.</li>
            <li class="lst">Progress is falling short of all of our indicators across agriculture and land use, where
              policy has been lacking or ineffective in driving the necessary emissions reductions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li class="lst">There has been good progress in the power sector, driven by strong policy. Policy has
          incentivised renewable power generation and driven down costs in doing so, pushed coal to
          the margins of the electricity system through carbon pricing, and reduced demand through
          efficiency improvements mostly driven by regulation and product standards. Although
          isolated, this represents a significant success and is clear evidence that emissions can be
          driven down by a well-designed, comprehensive policy package.
        </li>
        <li class="lst">At a high level, progress in industry has been good, but it is important to look beneath this to
          understand whether progress is due to action to decarbonise or wider shifts in technology
          and the economy. Our decomposition analysis, which seeks to attribute changes to different
          drivers of emissions, suggests that over the period 2012-2017 industrial output grew 14%,
          and that the 12% fall in direct CO₂ emissions can be attributed to a structural movement
          towards a less carbon-intensive mix of industrial output (accounting for 20% of the change),
          improvements in energy intensity (40%) and changes in fuel mix (40%). It is not clear
          whether these reductions were driven by policy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite the lack of progress in deploying measures to reduce emissions, overall emissions are
        below the level required to meet the second and third carbon budgets. As we explain in Chapter
        4, this is because of lower economic activity than expected when the first three budgets were
        recommended in 2008, together with changes in the EU emissions trading system that affect
        emissions accounting under carbon budgets.</p>

      <p>We plan to update our indicator set once we have assessed the pathway towards net-zero
        emissions by 2050 as part of advising on the sixth carbon budget. This is likely to entail both
        reassessment of the level of indicators to reflect the need for more rapid deployment (e.g. of
        electric vehicles) and a broadening of the indicator set (e.g. on the demand side).</p>

    <section id="progress">
      <strong class="strong">2. Progress in policy development</strong>

      <p>Our previous progress reports have set out the ‘policy gap’ to meeting the fourth and fifth
        carbon budgets, both of which were set on the cost-effective path to achieving an 80%
        reduction in emissions by 2050. These budgets will need to be outperformed on the way to
        achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

      <p>Over the last year, Government estimates of the policy gap to the fourth and fifth carbon
        budgets have gone up due to increases in their projections of ‘baseline’ emissions (i.e. before
        policy) outweighing additional savings due to new policies:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst">Projections of future overall UK emissions out to 2035 are largely unchanged in the 2018
          edition of the Government's Energy and Emissions Projections (EEP), published in April 2019,
          compared to the previous edition. However, within this total there has been a shift from
          emissions covered by the EU emissions trading system (i.e. the 'traded' sector) towards nontraded
          sectors. Because of emissions accounting rules under carbon budgets (see Box 1.2),
          this has increased the projected shortfall in meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets.</li>

        <li class="lst">Only three new policies have been quantified and newly included within these projections:
          Boiler Plus, Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting for Business, and Industrial Heat
          Recovery Support. The savings newly included from these policies amount to less than 5
          MtCO₂e across each of the five-year fourth and fifth carbon budget periods. There remain
          many other areas in which significant ambitions were outlined by the Government in the
          Clean Growth Strategy in October 2017, but where policy has not yet been finalised.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall, the shortfalls to meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets have each increased by 40-
        50 MtCO₂e across each of the respective five-year periods. This approximately reverses the
        downward change to the projections made in the preceding edition of EEP, meaning that the
        policy gaps to the fourth and fifth carbon budgets are likely to be similar to our assessment of 65
        MtCO₂e made January 2018 (prior to these two updates to the projections). It remains urgently
        necessary to close the policy gap to these carbon budgets and to get onto a path to meet the
        net-zero target.</p>

      <p>In our June 2018 progress report we set out a range of actions required over the following year
        (i.e. by now) to get on track to meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets and the 80% target
        for 2050. In the intervening 12 months there has been disappointing overall progress, with only
        one milestone out of 25 delivered in full. There are 10 without even partial progress (Table 3.2),
        including strengthening incentives for uptake of electric vehicles and policy to drive
        improvements to energy efficiency for 'able-to-pay' households.</p><br>
    </section>

    <section id="transport">
      <b>Transport</b>

      <p>Transport is now the highest-emitting sector and must be a key contributor towards the
        reductions in greenhouse gas emissions needed over the period to 2030. Delays in making
        policy progress present a significant risk to meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets and are
        also likely to lead to higher costs and worse air quality. Policy progress over the last year has
        been very limited:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst">Necessary progress has not been made on standards for new car and van CO₂ emissions nor
          on strengthening incentives to purchase cleaner vehicles. The Road to Zero strategy was
          published last year, but was insufficiently clear about what cars and vans would be permitted
          to be sold after conventional cars and vans are phased out. The phase-out date of 2040 is too
          late to ensure that the fleet is fully switched over to zero-emission vehicles by 2050 and fails
          Chapter 3: Underlying progress in the UK towards deep emissions reduction 55
          to grasp the opportunity of electric vehicles that are expected to be cheaper to buy, cheaper
          to run and less polluting from before 2030.</li>

        <li class="lst">A voluntary commitment has been made by the freight sector to reduce emissions by 15%
          by 2025. However, it remains unclear how this target will be achieved: greater incentives and
          monitoring will be needed to ensure progress. Whilst there have been positive
          developments in terms of awarding funding for low-emission buses and for sustainable
          transport improvements in a select number of cities, bus usage has continued to decline.</li>

        <li class="lst">The Government launched a consultation in December 2018 on its long-term vision for
          aviation. Within this, it accepted the Committee’s long-standing planning assumption that
          for an economy-wide target of an 80% emissions reduction, aviation emissions in 2050
          should be no higher than those in 2005 (i.e. 37.5 MtCO₂e). However, the final Aviation
          Strategy has not yet been published and the Government has not set out the implications of
          limiting emissions for aviation demand.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="box31">
      <b>Efficiency</b>
      <p>New-car CO2 emissions is an important indicator that car manufacturers are making progress in
        introducing less carbon-intensive vehicles. Following improvements in the average CO2 emitted per
        km from new cars from when regulations were introduced in 2009 to 2016, gCO2/km rose over the past
        two years.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst">In 2018 the average test-cycle CO2 intensity of cars sold in the UK has risen from 121.1 to 124.5
          gCO2/km, a 2.9% increase.</li>
        <li class="lst">There has been a significant shift towards large vehicles, which now represent 31% of new car
          sales, compared to 21% in 2010. This change in the size of cars alone contributed a 1.8% increase in
          new car CO2 intensity.</li>
        <li class="lst">The market share of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles increased from 4.7% to 6% in 2018.
          Without this change in market share, average new car CO2 intensity would have been 0.6% higher.</li>
        <li class="lst">In 2018, 68% of new cars were tested under the old test-cycle regime (the New European Driving
          Cycle) and 32% under the new regime (the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure),
          which makes true comparisons difficult. Emissions intensity excluding the new test results would
          have been 122.7 gCO2/km, a 1.3% increase from 2017, lower than the 2.9% increase when all values
          are included.</li>
        <li class="lst">New diesel car sales fell from a 42% share to 32%, with a corresponding increase in petrol sales to
          62%. The majority of the increase in petrol sales has been in larger vehicles, leading to a rise in the
          overall average CO2 intensity of petrol vehicles.</li>
        <li class="lst">Diesel cars had a higher average carbon intensity than petrol for the first time since 2010. The new
          test regime has led to car manufacturers reporting intensities around 10% higher for new diesel
          vehicles compared to vehicles tested under the old test regime. There has been a 5% increase for
          petrol vehicles. However, as there are no vehicles tested using both tests in the reported measurements it is not
          possible to say how much of this increase is due to changes in the measurement process, or
          whether there are also underlying changes in new car CO2 intensities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whilst the transition to the more rigorous test-cycle is welcome, it has introduced new sources of
        uncertainty. Nevertheless, it is clear that UK average new car CO2 intensity is increasing. The EU-wide
        new car average carbon intensity target is 95 gCO2/km by 2020/21. Whilst provisional data from the EU
        indicates that new car CO2 is currently lower across the EU (compared to the UK) at 120.4 gCO2/km in
        2018, the EU has also experienced an increase for the second year running. These increases mean that
        achieving this target on a UK-basis now requires a reduction of 8.6% each year for the next three years,
        which the UK is not currently on track to deliver.</p><br>
    </section>
    <section id="electric">
      <b>Electric Vehicles</b>
      <p>Electric vehicle market share rose in 2018 to 2.5%, an increase of 35% over the previous year. Of these,
        plug-in hybrid electric vehicles represented 74%, with pure battery electric vehicles representing 26%.
        The Committee’s indicator to be on track for the fifth carbon budget had a 3.4% market share for
        electric vehicles in 2018.</p>

      <p>The number of electric vehicle models available for sale has remained approximately stable between
        June 2018 and July 2019, but the electric range of the vehicles on offer has improved, with 9 models
        now available with over 200 miles of range. In November 2018, the Government cut the Plug-in car
        grant to a maximum of £3,500 for battery electric vehicles, and removed the grant for plug-in hybrid
        vehicles. Whilst it is too early to ascertain the impact of this on the electric vehicle market, it remains
        important to provide support in the near term. A significant number of manufacturer announcements
        have indicated that a much larger range of electric vehicle models will become available for sale before
        the end of 2020, the majority of which will have over 200 miles of range.</p>

      <p>Electric vehicle charging infrastructure has also improved, with 23,500 chargers available in June 2019,
        compared to 16,700 in June 2018. Rapid charger numbers have increased from 3,500 in 1,100 locations
        in June 2018 to 5,100 chargers available in 1,500 locations in June 2019. The UK’s first 350 kW ultrarapid
        charge point was opened in April in Sunderland. Councils have begun to provide infrastructure
        for drivers without an off-street parking space in which to install a charger, with 28 councils taking up
        funding from the Office for Low Emission Vehicles for installing public chargers near homes.</p><br>

    <section id="demand">
      <b>Demand</b>

      <p>Demand for car travel rose by 0.2% in 2018, a slower rise than in the previous four years. Statistics for
        walking, cycling and bus usage are reported separately by each devolved administration:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst">The number of local bus journeys declined in 2018 in England (1.6%) and Scotland (5.1%), and
          increased in Wales (0.7%) and Northern Ireland (1%).</li>
        <li class="lst">In England, the number of parts of journeys walked and cycled increased from the previous year by
          3% and 15% respectively in 2017, the latest year for which data are available.</li>
        <li class="lst">In Wales, the number of people cycling at least once a week as a means of transport rose by 20% in
          2017/18, whereas the number of people walking at least once a week as transport fell by 5%.</li>
        <li class="lst">For Scotland and Northern Ireland, data is not currently available on the number of walking or
          cycling trips for 2017 or 2018.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="industry">
      <b>Industry</b>
      <p>There has been a surge in policy activity for industrial decarbonisation in the past year, including
        the setting of the Government’s industrial decarbonisation clusters mission, which aims to
        establish the world’s first net-zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040 and at least one low-carbon
        cluster by 2030. Despite this activity, proposals and ambitions need to be turned into clear and
        concrete policies and further ambition is required.</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li class="lst">Two significant decarbonisation funds for capital expenditure were announced in the past
          year: the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund (IEFT) and the Industrial Strategy Challenge
          Fund (ISCF) (Figure 3.1). The Government plans to consult formally on the design of the IETF
          in autumn 2019 and the ISCF plans to launch an expression of interest in autumn 2019. Both
          schemes will have a significant challenge deploying large-scale fuel switching or carbon
          capture and storage (CCS) in industry unless ongoing support for operational expenditure is
          provided to complement the schemes, which Government is currently considering.
        <li class="lst">The UK CCUS Action Plan was published in November 2018, setting out Government’s
          plans on industrial CCS, including a commitment to consult on a market-based industrial
          carbon capture framework in 2019. In June 2019, Government awarded £26m of innovationlevel
          funding for nine carbon capture, usage and storage projects.</li>
        <li class="lst">There have been a number of further policy developments on energy efficiency. The
          Environmental Reporting Guidelines have been in force since April 2019, including
          streamlined energy and carbon reporting guidance. Climate Change Levy rates increased in
          April 2019 by 45% for electricity and 67% for gas. The first round of funding from the
          Industrial Heat Recovery Support project started in December 2018. The Government
          initiated an evaluation of the Climate Change Agreements, expected to conclude later in
          2019.48 However, the Government has not set out how the improvements of 20% in business
          energy efficiency committed to in the Clean Growth Strategy will be achieved.</li>
